# Product Team Vue.js Coding Test

Thanks for taking the time to do the test!

You will need an invision account for this. If you don't have one you can get a free one at:
https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/signup

It should take somewhere between 1 and 2 hours to complete the test. While working on it, it would be great if you could make regular git commits so we can see how you progressed during the build.

## Submission

Please create a public git (eg. github, or similar) repo that you can push to all you commits to. Then pass the url of the repo back to us.

## Requirements

**Feature/Story Description:**

A “chat-bot” style page that allows a user to answer questions in the form of a messaging conversation.

**As a** Product Manager

**I want to** have a chat-bot that allows us to ask the user a set of questions

**So that** users can easily provide the information required to continue with the journey.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** (User Interface)
Can I...

1. See a “Typing” indicator (3 dots) for 1 second before each message is received
2. See a message that shows that the chat-bot has received my reply

**Functional Requirements:**
Can I...

1. Use the page on Desktop and Mobile
2. Select a radio button to respond to a question
3. Change my response to a previous answer (Selecting a different option should show the ‘Typing’ indicator again, and then display a message with the updated result)
